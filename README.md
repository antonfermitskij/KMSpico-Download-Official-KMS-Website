In this article, I will tell you everything about this fantastic tool, even though I will also tell you if this is safe to use.

In this case, don’t forget to read this article until the end, so you don’t miss any critical information. This guide is for both beginners and experts as I came up with some of the rumours spreading throughout the internet.

Perhaps before we move towards downloading or installing a section, we must first understand this tool. You should check out the guide below on this tool and how it works; if you already know about it, you can move to another section.

**Please Take a Note**:

## What is KMSPico?

**KMPico is a tool that is used to activate or get a license for [Microsft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_Windows_versions) as well as for MS Office. It was developed by one of the most famous developers named, Team Daz.** However, it is entirely free to use. There is no need to purchase it or spend money downloading it. This works on the principle of Microsft’s feature named Key Management Server, a.k.a KMS (KMSPico named derived from it).

The feature is used for vast companies with many machines in their place. In this way, it is hard to buy a Windows License for each device,, which is why KMS introduced. Now a company has to buy a KMS server for them and use it when they can get a license for all their machines.

However, this tool also works on it, and similarly, it creates a server on your machine and makes it look like a part of that server. One thing different is that this tool only keeps the product activated for 180 days. This is why it keeps running on your machine, renews the license keys after 180 days, and makes it a permanent activation.

## Features

We already know what this tool means, so let’s talk about some of the features you are getting along with KMSPico. Reading this will surely help you understand whether you are downloading the correct file.

_Ok, so here are some of the features that KMSPico provides:_

**Activate Windows & Office**

We have already talked about this earlier, as using this tool, you will get the installation key for both Microsoft Products. Whether it is Windows or Office, you can get a license in no time; however, this supports various versions.

**Supports Multi-Arch**

Since this supports both products, it doesn’t mean you have to download separate versions for each arch. One version is enough, and you can get the license for both x32-bit or even the x64-bit.

**It Is Free To Use**

Undoubtedly, everything developed by Team Daz costs nothing to us. Similarly, using this tool won’t cost you either, as it is entirely free. Other than this, it doesn’t come with any ads, so using it won’t be any trouble.

**Permanent License**

Due to the KMS server, this tool installs on our PC, we will get the license key for the rest of our lives. This is because the license automatically renews after a few days. To keep it permanent, you must connect your machine to the internet once 180 days.

**Virus Free**

Now comes the main feature of this tool that makes it famous among others. KMSPico is 100% pure and clean from such viruses or trojans. The Virus Total scans it before uploading to ensure it doesn’t harm our visitors.

## Download KMSPico Activator

After reading the precautions regarding this tool, if you are ready to get it, here is how you can download it from our website. The downloading process is simple enough, but still, many people might not be aware of it, so this guide will be helpful for them.

 **[Download KMSpico](https://kmspico.io/downloading-kmspico/)**

_Just follow the given below steps to download KMSPico on your machine instantly:_

- First, you need to click on the **Save** button that appears in this guide.
- 2. When you click on it, you will see a new Window pop, and here you will see the **Download Now** or **Mirror Link** button.
- **Download Now** is for the **Mega** hoster, while the **Mirror** Link is for the **MediaShare** hoster.
- Now click on Download Now or click the Mirror link, depending on you, so once you click, it will again open another window.
- Here you will see the website of **Mediafire** or Mega (depending on which one you open).
- Once you open their website in Mediafire, click on **Download,** and an ad pop-up link appears. After this, the Download will start.
- However, for Mega users, you can click on Download in the Browser button and wait until it downloads.
- Once the tool is downloaded in Mega, it will be added to the Download **Manager** in **Firefox**, Chrome, or whatever browser you are using.

KMSPico is now successfully downloaded, and you are done with it. I would recommend using the IDM to boost your downloading. Other than this, the Mega link would be perfect as it has the fastest servers and no ads.

## How To Install KMSPico

After following the above guide, you downloaded this tool anyway. Now comes the second part of this guide, which is installing KMSPico. This is not difficult at all, but somehow there are some precautions that you need to take.

As we know, this tool is used to get product keys, so it is not easy to install. That’s why I am writing this guide, so the newbies don’t face any issues after all.

_Okay, so enough talk. Let’s check out the below steps to Install KMSPico:_

First of all, we have to disable the Antivirus or Windows Defender in the case of installing this tool. As I already told earlier that some Antivirus and Windows defenders restrict this as it is used to get a license.

You need to right-click the Antivirus icon on your taskbar and then click Exit, Close, or whatever option you see.

It would be best if you also disabled **Windows Defender**, for open **Start** **Menu** > **Search** for **Windows Defender** and select the first option > Now open **Virus** **& Threat Protection** > Then under **Virus** **& Threat Protection Settings,** click **Manage Settings** > Next, disable **Real-Time protection** using that switcher.

![download-kmspico](http://kmspico.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/download-kmspico.png "download-kmspico")

Once the Antivirus or WD is disabled, go to the **File Manager** and locate the folder where you downloaded KMSPico.

![kmspico-activator](http://kmspico.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kmspico-activator-1024x703.png "kmspico-activator")

Here you will see the zip file using the Windows Archiver or WinRar. Just **extract the file** from that folder.

![kmspico-software](http://kmspico.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kmspico-software-1024x553.png "kmspico-software")

When extracting the Zip file, you will be asked to enter your **password** to get a password from here and then type that password.

Once the files are extracted, a new folder will appear, and after you open it, you will see the KMSPico.exe app there. At this time, double, click on that exe file or right-click and then click **Run as Administrator**.

![kmspico-official-download](http://kmspico.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kmspico-official-download-1024x574.png "kmspico-official-download")

It will then open a Windows Installer there, so follow all the steps you see there and install it like any ordinary software.

![kmspico-activator-Download-Install](http://kmspico.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kms-pico-1024x576.png "kmspico-activator-Download-Install")

Once the installation is finished, click Finish or Close whatever you see there. That’s it. We are also done here, so now you might be wondering about the activation. Well! Then it would be best if you kept reading this guide. In the below guide, I will tell you how to activate Windows using KMSPico.

## How To Activate Windows Using KMSpico

After the installation process is completed, it doesn’t mean that this tool will work on its own. But we still need to follow some steps to keep it working. However, you can check this guide for complete installation instructions and the screenshots attached below.

Please make sure to keep your Windows Defender and any other Antivirus tool disabled. After this step, you can activate them again, so disable them first.

_Once you have disabled both things, now need to follow the below steps to activate Windows using the KMSPico:_

First, right-click on **My Computer** and select **Properties** from the menu to launch system information. Now here, check the Windows activation and then close it right after.

![kmspico-windows-10](http://kmspico.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kmspico-windows-10-1024x576.png "kmspico-windows-10")

At this time, open the **Start Menu** by clicking on the Windows icon at the taskbar or pressing the keyboard’s logo key.

![kmspico-tool-kms](http://kmspico.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kmspico-tool-1024x576.png "kmspico-tool-kms")

Now look for the **KMSPico** in the current section or otherwise search for this term and open KMSPico instead of AutoKMS (check the below screenshot).

![kmspico-windows-10-activator](http://kmspico.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kmspico-windows-10-activator-1.png "kmspico-windows-10-activator")

Once the tool is launched, you will notice the Windows icon appears with only one **red** button.

![windows-10-kmspico](http://kmspico.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/windows-10-kmspico-1024x506.png "windows-10-kmspico")

You need to click on that red button and then wait until you hear a sound. After completing the task, you will be notified by sound saying “**Program** **Complete.**”

Now you will notice the Windows logo background turned white, which means the activation is succeeded. After this, you need to restart your computer, and once it is done, just right-click on the My Computer icon and open properties.

At this time, scroll down and check the Windows Activation status there; if it is Activated appears, it means you are done here. Other than this, if you didn’t see anything, you need to follow all the above steps from the beginning, as you may miss some.

Perhaps I think you will succeed in it as. I have also attached the screenshots that could help you a little bit. However, this method isn’t working for the Microsoft Office action, so you must follow the guide below.

## Activate Microsoft Office With KMS

Above is the guide on activating Microsoft Windows using the KMSPico tool. However, the guide is almost the same for the Office as well, but there is still something that you need to follow. You can use this guide for various Office versions like 2007, 2010, 2103, 2016, and even 365.

_To Activate Microsoft Office with KMSPico, you just need to follow the given below steps carefully:_

1. As I have already mentioned many times, the first step is always to keep your Antivirus disabled, and once it’s done, let’s move towards the next step.

2. Now, you need to open one of the Microsoft Office Products, whether it is Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or anything of your choice, and then minimize it.

3. After this, you need to open **Start Menu** from the taskbar.

![Activate-Microsoft-Office-With-KMS-Kmspico](http://kmspico.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Activate-Microsoft-Office-With-KMS.jpg "Activate-Microsoft-Office-With-KMS-Kmspico")

4. When it is launched, look in the current section and open **KMSPico** otherwise, use the search box to type its name and open it.

![Activate-Microsoft-Office-With-KMSpico](http://kmspico.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Activate-Microsoft-Office-With-KMSpico.jpg "Activate-Microsoft-Office-With-KMSpico")

5. After the KMSPico tool is launched on your computer, you will notice the same single button with the Windows icon, but at this time, a new icon will appear (the icon for **Office**).

Please Take a Note:

If the icon doesn’t show there, close the Office App and relaunch it, similarly relaunch this tool as well until you see the office icon there.

6. You need to click on the **Red** button from that window and wait for a few seconds.

![Official-KMS-Pico-Website-kmspico](http://kmspico.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Official-KMS-Pico-Website.jpg "Official-KMS-Pico-Website-kmspico")

Once all set, you will hear the same sound, like Affirmative & Program Completed. After hearing that voice, you will notice that the Windows & Office icon background turned **green**.

This means the Office is now licensed successfully; however, if the background doesn’t appear, then without any doubt, you have to follow all the steps again. Keep trying this unless the green background doesn’t appear, but just in case you keep trying the steps several times, and the background doesn’t appear.

This could be the reason for a glitch in the tool, so we need to check manually if it is registered. For this, restart your computer and launch any Office products. Once it is opened, click on the Files from the above menu.

From the left panel, click on the Account, and then from the right-hand side, you will see the product information. Now check if you see the message “Product Activate” if this is available, then no doubt it is registered. But if this doesn’t appear, all you need to do is Uninstall and Install Office again and then try if the problem is still there.

## Is KMSpico Safe?

KMSPico is a tool to pirate Windows & Office keys; perhaps there is no such virus or malicious code. This is 100% safe and secures even t, hough I have checked it on my own and didn’t find anything at all. However, several versions of this tool are already available on various websites, so there could be a chance that it may contain any malicious files.
